# Toontown Offline Issue Tracker
Welcome to the official issue tracker for [Toontown Offline](https://ttoffline.com/). This is the one-stop-shop for reporting any issues you experience while playing the game. If you're simply curious about which bugs are known or fixed, have a look at the issues tab and find out for yourself!

# How do I report an issue?
Simply head over to the [issues](https://github.com/Toontown-Offline-Issue-Tracker/issues/issues) tab of this repository to submit a new issue.
Please follow the following guidelines as you write up your issue:
```
Include a detailed description of what happened. The more context, the better.
Example questions you should think to yourself:
- What gamemode were you playing?
- Did an error message pop up on your screen when the issue happened?
- If so, what did it say? What were you doing directly before your issue occurred?
```
```
Always attach the following file when you submit your issue:
- The most recently generated log found in the "logs" folder of your Toontown Offline installation.

If you were playing on Offline Mode, or your own Mini-Server, attach the following:
- The three most recently generated logs found in the subfolders (astron, uberdog, ai) of the "logs" folder.
```
```
Label your issue well. 
We have created various labels you can use to help us better categorize your problem. 
If you do not know what a certain label means, do not use it.
```
```
Try your best to avoid submitting a duplicate issue.
```
